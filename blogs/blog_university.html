        <p>
          <strong>Years 1 & 2:</strong> The first two years were all about the
          basics: anatomy, physiology, physics, and electronics. It felt like
          stepping into two worlds at once: medicine and engineering. Honestly,
          it was overwhelming at times, but also exciting because it laid the
          ground for everything that came after. Most days were spent buried in
          classrooms and libraries, slowly piecing together the foundation we‚Äôd
          build on later.

        <p>
          <strong>Year 3:</strong> We finally got into courses like imaging,
          medical devices, and software systems, and it wasn‚Äôt just theory
          anymore. Labs and projects started to connect the dots ‚Äî I could
          actually see how what we were learning could turn into real healthcare
          solutions. It was the first time I felt, ‚Äúokay, this is why I chose
          biomedical engineering.‚Äù

          <strong>Years 4 & 5:</strong> Senior year was all about sleepless
          nights, working side by side with my team, and of course, our
          graduation project. It was exhausting but honestly the most rewarding
          part of the whole journey. Every assignment, every presentation felt
          less like schoolwork and more like real preparation for what comes
          after.

        Our project focused on

        CNNs, TensorFlow, and Unity to create a system that could aid doctors in
        diagnosis and surgical planning.

          Morning walks to campus, usually rushing because I was almost late.

          Late nights working on assignments, surviving on tea, snacks, and
          random chats with friends.

          Exams that felt impossible at the time but later just turned into
